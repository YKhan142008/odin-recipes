    <h1>Apple Pie Recipe</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Bramley apples</li>
        <li>140g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>300g fresh lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet. <br>
            Quarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick and lay evenly on the baking sheet. <br>
            Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). <br>
            Beat together for just under 1 min – it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it’s <br>
            beginning to clump up, then finish gathering it together with your hands. Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, <br>
            and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. <br>
            Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin – <br>
            20-22cm round and 4cm deep – leaving a slight overhang. Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. 
            Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. <br>
            Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. (Can be frozen at this stage.) <br>
            Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden, then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. <br> 
            Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.</li>
      
    </ul>
